# Mobile Weather App.

### Project 02

---

As my second project i made a mobile oriented app that contains current weather conditions and some other climate details.
It has a switch celsius-fahrenheit that can be used when the menu button is triggered.

### **Technologies used**

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Tailwind.css
- React - useContext
- Git - Github

### **Libraries - Frameworks usage**.

### Tailwind framework to style

In this project i used Tailwind because i saw that it was the easiest and faster way to add specific details in some situations.<br/>
I saw that a con was that it reduce code readability, as it uses classes.

### React and state management

I used also React with it's hooks, with the purpose of trying to be as easy to read as possible, and also convenient for " performance ". <br/>
Usage of useContext Hook for the state, where i managed the API info and some setStates for the actions that i needed in different components.

### **First time using Git & Github**

I learned also how to submit my projects code to Github by using Git, thanks to freecodecamp :). <br>
But im also willing to learn more in depth those git commands that i didn't used for this project.
